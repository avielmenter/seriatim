# Seriatim
A web application for creating outlines.

# About
Seriatim is a web application for writing outlines. Seriatim was originally designed to make outlines for law school, although nothing about the application requires that the outlines be used for this purpose.

This repository contains only the code for the Seriatim front-end website and editor application. The code for the server will be coming soon.

Seriatim is currently in early development. It is not a complete application.

## Try It!
You can try the most recent working version of the Seriatim outline editor at [seriatim.surge.sh](https://seriatim.surge.sh). Note that, at this stage of development, your outline cannot be saved, and will not persist if you leave or refresh the page.
